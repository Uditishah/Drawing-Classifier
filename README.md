This code defines a DrawingClassifier class that enables users to create, train, and use a machine learning model to classify hand-drawn images into three user-defined classes. The application uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface and various machine learning classifiers from the scikit-learn library. 
This code allows you to define three custom classes and then to draw the respective drawings. By clicking the buttons of the individual classes, you add one training file to the model. Then you can train it (choose one of multiple classifiers) and predict future drawings.
